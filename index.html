            <p>Soldier of Fortune is a fast paced first person shooter that a very high level competitive scene</p>
            <p>My competitive drive all started here. Learning the basics, all the mechanics, all the maps.
               Over the first few months I was able to increase my skills to draw attention of some of the well known teams.

               After an invitation to my first team, my gaming career kicked off with joining and eventually winning several tournaments.

            <p>
               Starcraft2 was short lived for me as I was not good at RTS games. Playing in small solo online tournaments made me realize how much I missed the team aspect of competitive gaming.
            </p>
            <p>
               I did and still do enjoy playing through all the campains and custom games that people create.

               As I moved from game to game I became more curious. How do games actually work?? Web games? PC, Playstation, xbox? Multiplayer and single player
            </p>
            <p>Cue Google, Udemy, and Youtube</p>

            <p>I excitedly jumped down the rabbit hold as if I was Alice in Wonderland. I started with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
            <p>I found a very simple old school pong code along to get me started. You can check it out <a href="https://keithpohl.com/pong/Tennis.html">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>After a little practice I decided I needed more and started in Unreal Engine 4 with C++. 
               Ever since I have started my journy I have always wanted to remake the game that started it all, Soldier of Fortune II</p>

            <p>Apex Legends reignited my spark for high level competitive game play. I started polishing the rust off since day 1 of its release.</p>
            <p>My skills in Apex Legends quickly improved more and more. The more I would grind the more I desired to make my own game come to life.</p>

            <p>Here we are today. I still have a passion to build video games and will complete my dream game. For now I need to get back to basics and really focus on the understanding</p>
            <p>LaunchCode is a blessing. It helps hold me accountable to make sure I am completing project and more so that I understand what I am learning.</p>
